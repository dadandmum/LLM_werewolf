\begin{abstract}
  With the groundbreaking advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the industrial field, numerous LLM agent frameworks have been proposed to address issues across various domains. However, in academic circles, there has been an overemphasis on the accuracy of LLM outputs, while the benefits derived from their inherent uncertainty have been overlooked. The robust richness endowed by the randomness of LLMs in products is highly appealing to content creators. In this study, we base our exploration on social deduction games to investigate how a LLM agent system integrated with multiple strategy models can demonstrate the capability of generating rich content during gameplay. Inspired by the fields of personality classification in psychology, game engineering, and cutting-edge LLM science, we propose an LLM agent framework encompassing the following subsystems: a personality trait description system capable of endowing LLM agents with diverse character traits; a favor system that takes into account the relationships between agents; and a strategy system that allows for the rumination of information and provision of strategies. In our experiments, this multi-strategy hybrid system exhibited positive feedback on the richness of agent text output across different dimensions and demonstrated the potential for creating engaging game content.
